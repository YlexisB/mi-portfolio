          "the-build": "Skatefy was developed using a dynamic mix of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the React.js library. Leveraging the power of these technologies, this immersive web app simulates a skateboarding school experience, offering an array of features, including private lessons, video coaching, and beyond beginner lessons. Skatefy serves as a one-stop destination for skateboarding enthusiasts of all levels. To ensure seamless deployment and continuous integration, GitHub Actions were implemented for CI/CD processes, making the project accessible on GitHub Pages.",
          "the-inspiration1": "Despite never having set foot on a skateboard myself,  skateboarding culture and the creativity of it has always fascinated me. In creating Skatefy, I wanted to bridge my fascination with  skateboarding and use web development as a way to build a site that offers services in skateboarding lessons. ",
          "the-inspiration2": "Beyond my personal connection to skateboarding, Skatefy was designed to inspire businesses seeking to elevate their online presence. CSS, React.js, and intuitive design is a great formula to do so. Skatefy showcases how these elements can be used together to create a visually captivating and user-friendly platform. ",
          "the-design": "Leveraging the awesome tool of Canva Pro, I created and edited all graphic materials, ensuring they seamlessly blended into the site's overall aesthetic. The choice of colors, a vital aspect of any design, was curated within Canva Pro as well. To enhance the site's narrative, I sourced royalty-free and stock images from the Pexels.com and Adobe Stock platforms. Additionally, the project draws inspiration from the exceptional UI/UX design work of Olena Kmetiuk, particularly her Surfing School website. This inspiration fueled a unique challenge to recreate and reimagine a skateboarding school website, resulting in the visually captivating and user-friendly experience that is Skatefy. Your can find Kmetiuk's work here: https://www.behance.net/gallery/176919587/Surfing-school-Website-design",
          "the-learning": " One of the key discoveries was the use of 'vw' in CSS, a unit that dynamically scales text and elements to ensure responsive design. This newfound understanding allowed me to create text that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, enhancing the user experience. Additionally, I delved deeper into CSS Grid, a layout system I had previously explored less frequently, as I typically leaned on Flexbox. This experience broadened my design horizons and empowered me with versatile tools to craft visually appealing and user-friendly layouts. ",

It features seamless email integration through EmailJS and utilizes the power of React Slick for carousel image automation. This web application is designed to empower women on their fitness journeys by offering personalized training plans, expert guidance, and a supportive community.",
          "the-inspiration1": "The driving purpose behind the creation of the FemFit Gym website was to envision and design a gym that I would personally love to be part of. It was really about crafting the ideal gym experience that centers around members' fitness journeys and overall well-being. I wanted to provide a safe, inclusive space where women of all ages could not only achieve their fitness goals but also enjoy the process without the intimidation that can sometimes be felt in conventional gyms.",
          "the-inspiration2": "I also wanted to make a gym committed to lead generation â€“ motivating potential members to kickstart their fitness journeys even before setting foot in the facility. Ultimately, this project aims to merge user experience with a strong sense of community, making FemFit Gym more than just a gym; but a fictitious fitness family.",
          "the-design": "The design of the FemFit website was inspired by the talented Jemish Variya's UI/UX design of a gym website. You can find it showcased on Behance.com. I used canva.com to create all the design graphics, and materials. All images and videos are sourced from Pexels.com and AdobeStock.The design prioritizes an intuitive and visually appealing user experience, ensuring that every element, color, and layout choice is carefully crafted to enhance the overall aesthetics and usability of the website. Here is the link behind FemFitâ€™s inspiration:  https://www.behance.net/gallery/175372135/GYM-Website",
          "the-learning": "One of the significant takeaways was the ability to closely align my design sensibilities with those of another website. While I handled the entire process, from crafting graphics to sourcing images, page stylization and writing code, I drew inspiration from a UI/UX design on another platform. This experience allowed me to understand the importance of translating creative visions  into functional web elements. Email integration via emailJS and the  implementation of the React Slick Carousel expanded my toolkit for enhanced user experiences. This project also improved my time management, allowing me to handle multiple aspects concurrently. Additionally, I explored Formik for efficient form creation, adding to my web development skill set and deepening my understanding of tools commonly used within the web dev field.",

          "the-build": "Snap Still is the first React website I have ever built. This website was built using HTML,CSS, and React JS via CRA npm. The images are fetched from the Pexels API, and the mood board thumbnails are fetched from the Giphy API. I used localStorage to save the Pexel Api data to a mood board, in order for it to be accessed in each board's mood board page. The site features six initial categories of common emotions shown in film, and displays images in relation to each of those categories. Users are also given the opportunity to utilize the search engine, located at the top-right corner of each page.",
          "the-inspiration1": "The inspiration behind Snap Still is deeply rooted in my filmmaking background. As any filmmaker knows, the planning phase is absolutely crucial for successfully bringing a project to life, and that's where our trusty mood boards come to the rescue. ðŸŽ¬ðŸŽ¥ A mood board is a collage of visual elements, carefully curated to evoke a specific mood, style, or concept. It lets you see the big picture and grasp the overall feel you want to convey in your project, and itâ€™s a powerful tool that bridges the gap between imagination and reality.",
          "the-inspiration2": "In the past, I found myself resorting to PowerPoint or Google Slides, engaging in a convoluted process of hunting down images on Google, saving them to my desktop computer, organizing them into folders, and finally pasting them into my Slides or PowerPoint. Phew, all that for a task so simple! That's why I wanted to create a website like Snap Still. Itâ€™s a platform where creatives from all walks of life can effortlessly craft their mood boards. And with Snap Still, a user can create multiple mood boards in one convenient place, without all the unnecessary hassle.",
          "the-design": "As far as design goes, I was inspired by the site eycndy.com. The images pop from  the background, and they have collage style images shown as well. From the start I knew I wanted colorful elements against a dark background for that same effect. I also wanted the design to be simple. I designed the site in Figma and at first thought the site looked a bit too simple. So then I designed another version of the site and realized it looked  a bit too busy, so I decided to move along with my original design.",
          "the-learning": "Through this project, I discovered the importance of thorough research in the development process. As I progressed, I realized the need to delve deeper into React Hooks and localStorage . I spent a lot of time conducting extensive research during the building phase. This process not only expanded my knowledge of these concepts but also boosted my confidence in pursuing future React projects. I learned that conducting research is vital and that itâ€™s okay to ask other fellow developers for help and feedback as well. I also learned about code etiquette, and keeping the code as neat as possible.This is where keeping a Constants file comes into play, to help keep the code clean, and also makes it easier for someone to reuse.",
